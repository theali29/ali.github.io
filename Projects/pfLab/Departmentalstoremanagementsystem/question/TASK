LAB PROJECT
Deparmental Store Management System
Your task is to design a departmental store management system. The store has multiple shelves with numbers on it for placing multiple items, initially the shelf 
is empty, means that there is no item on the shelf. The store consists of k number of shelves, and each shelf has exactly p number of positions for items to be placed
on it. The store wants to design a software to keep the records of item on the shelves. The software should be able to perform the following operations:
1.	Insert the item at a particular position in a given shelf, if it’s empty else place the item in the first empty location in that shelf, and if there is no
location empty on that shelf then do not insert it and display the appropriate message to the user.
2.	Display all the items in a given shelf.
3.	Remove the item from particular position in a given shelf if it is there.
4.	Remove all the item from a given shelf
5.	Return total number of the items in the specified shelf
6.	Return the total number of items in all the shelves.
7.	Find item in the store and return the shelf number and its position if it exists.
8.	Update the item at given position (can be empty or filled) by replacing it with the new item.
9.	Check if the shelf is empty
10.	Check if the shelf is full
Your process will start for asking number of shelves (k) and (p) positions on each shelf (Each shelf can have varying storage positions)
